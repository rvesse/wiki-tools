# Wiki Checker

A simple command line Java tool that verifies that a BitBucket wiki does not contain any broken links or other common problems.

# Usage

Run on a local clone of your wiki repository like so:

    > ./check /path/to/wiki
    
This will churn away for a while before producing a report both to stdout and to a file name report.txt
